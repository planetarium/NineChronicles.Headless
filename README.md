```

### Use `appsettings.{network}.json` to provide CLI options

You can provide headless CLI options using file, `appsettings.json`. You'll find the default file at [here](NineChronicles.Headless.Executable/appsettings.json).  
The path of `appsettings.json` can be either local file storage or URL.  
Refer full configuration fields from [this file](NineChronicles.Headless.Executable/Configuration.cs), set your options into `appsettings.json` under `Headless` section.  
You can also run headless server with previous way; You don't need to change anything if you don't want to.  
In case that the same option is provided from both `appsetting.json` and CLI option, the CLI option value is used instead from `appsettings.json`.  

The default `appsettings.json` is an example for your own appsettings file.  
`appsettings.{network}.json` are runnable appsettings file and you can run local node for each network using following command:
```shell
dotnet run --project NineChronicles.Headless.Executable -C appsettings.{network}.json --store-type={YOUR_OWN_STORE_PATH}
```
- appsettings.mainnet.json
  - This makes your node to connect to the Nine Chronicles mainnet (production).
- appsettings.internal.json
  - This makes your node to connect to the Nine Chronicles internal network, which is test before release new version.  
  - Internal network is kind of hard-fork of mainnet at some point to test new version.
  - You CANNOT use mainnet storage for internal headless node.
- appsettings.previewnet.json
  - This makes your node to connect to the Nine Chronicles preview network to show feature preview.
  - This network is totally different network from genesis block.
  - Previewnet can be restarted from genesis block without any announcement to prepare next feature.

Please make sure the store in the path you provided must save right data for the network to connect.  
You cannot share data from any of those networks.

If you want to run your own isolated local network, please copy `appsettings.json` to `appsettings.local.json` and edit the contents.  
```shell
cp appsettings.json appsettings.local.json
# Edit contents of appsettings.local.json
dotnet run --project NineChronicles.Headless.Executable -C appsettings.local.json --store-type={YOUR_OWN_STORE_PATH}
```

#### Caveat
APVs can be changed as Nine Chronicles deploys new version.  
You have to fit your APV sting to current on-chain version string.  
You can get APV strings at the following places:
- mainnet: [Official released config.json](https://release.nine-chronicles.com/9c-launcher-config.json) - `AppProtocolVersion`
- internal: [Internal network config](https://github.com/planetarium/9c-k8s-config/blob/main/9c-internal/configmap-versions.yaml) - `APP_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
- previewnet: [Previewnet config](https://github.com/planetarium/9c-k8s-config/blob/main/9c-previewnet/configmap-versions.yaml) - `APP_PROTOCOL_VERSION`

### Build with dev/test actions
Lib9c has several test-only actions. This will not be deployed to mainnet but you can run your own headless server with this test actions.  
Add `/p:ExtraDefineConstants=TEST_9C` when you build NineChronicles.Headless.Executable project.  
To do this, you should execute `build` command and `run` command separately.  
```shell
dotnet build NineChronicles.Headless.Executable /p:ExtraDefineConstants=TEST_9C
dotnet run --no-build --procjet NineChronicles.Headless.Executable -C appsettings.local.json
```
You can run this local headless to attach mainnet, but you cannot stage dev action tx to mainnet because the miner will not accept test actions.

## Docker Build

A headless image can be created by running the command below in the directory where the solution is located.

```
$ docker build . -t <IMAGE_TAG> --build-arg COMMIT=<VERSION_SUFFIX>
```
* Nine Chronicles Team uses `<VERSION_SUFFIX>` to build an image with the latest git commit and push to the [official Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/planetariumhq/ninechronicles-headless). However, if you want to build and push to your own Docker Hub account, the `<VERSION_SUFFIX>` can be any value.

### Format

Formatting for `PrivateKey` or `Peer` follows the format in [Nekoyume Project README][../README.md].

## How to run NineChronicles Headless on AWS EC2 instance using Docker

### On Your AWS EC2 Instance

#### Pre-requisites

#### 1. Pull `planetariumhq/ninechronicles-headless` Docker image to your AWS EC2 instance from the [official Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/planetariumhq/ninechronicles-headless).

- If you would like to build your own Docker image from your local machine, refer to [this section](#building-your-own-docker-image-from-your-local-machine).

```
$ docker pull planetariumhq/ninechronicles-headless:[<TAGNAME>] (ex: v100300)
```

$ docker run \
--detach \
--volume 9c-volume:/app/data \
planetariumhq/ninechronicles-headless:[<TAGNAME>] \
<a href = "#run" title="NineChronicles Headless options">[NineChronicles Headless Options]</a>
</pre>
#### Note)

- If you want to use the same headless options as your Nine Chronicles game client, please refer to the `headlessArgs` values in value in https://release.nine-chronicles.com/apv.json.
- If you are using an [Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) on your AWS instance, you can add the IP address in the `--host` option and not use the `--ice-server` option.
- For mining, make sure to include the `--miner-private-key` option with your private key.

## Nine Chronicles GraphQL API Documentation

Check out [Nine Chronicles GraphQL API Tutorial](https://www.notion.so/Getting-Started-with-Nine-Chronicles-GraphQL-API-a14388a910844a93ab8dc0a2fe269f06) to get you started with using GraphQL API with NineChronicles Headless.

For more information on the GraphQL API, refer to the [NineChronicles Headless GraphQL Documentation](http://api.nine-chronicles.com/).

---

## Create a new genesis block

### 1. (Optional) Create activation keys and PendingActivationState
Activation key is the code for 9c account to register/activate into NineChronicles.  
You can create activation key whenever you want later, so you can just skip this step.

```shell
dotnet run --project NineChronicles.Headless.Executable/NineChronicles.Headless.Executable.csproj -- tx create-activation-keys 10 > ActivationKeys.csv  # Change [10] to your number of new activation keys
dotnet run --project NineChronicles.Headless.Executable/NineChronicles.Headless.Executable.csproj -- tx create-pending-activations ActivationKeys.csv > PendingActivation
```

### 2. Create config file for genesis block
1. Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json`
2. Change values inside `config.json`
   - `data.tablePath` is required.
   - If you have `PendingActivation` file, set file path to `extra.pendingActivationStatePath`

### 3. Create genesis block
```shell
dotnet run --project ./NineChronicles.Headless.Executable/ genesis ./config.json
```
After this step, you will get `genesis-block` file as output and another info in addition.

### 4. Run Headless node with genesis block
```shell
dotnet run --project ./NineChronicles.Headless.Executable/ \
    -V=[APP PROTOCOL VERSION] \
    -G=[PATH/TO/GENESIS/BLOCK] \
    --store-type=memory \
    --store-path= [PATH/TO/BLOCK/STORAGE] \
    --workers=1000 \
    --host=localhost \
    --port=43210 \
    --miner-private-key=[PRIVATE_KEY_OF_BLOCK_MINER]
```
